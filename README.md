            <strong>Revenue Growth and Peak Performance:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>2020 was the strongest year, with sales consistently growing each quarter as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
              <li>Q4 2020 saw the highest revenue ($1.25M in December 2020), making it the best-performing period.</li>
              <li>January 2021 ($1.03M) also maintained strong sales, though a downward trend started afterward.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Declining Trend in 2022</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>A sales anomaly and significant decline occurred in 2022, particularly in Q4, with October ($178K), November ($208K), and December ($262K) marking the lowest revenue months.</li>
              <li>The Q3 and Q4 revenue decline suggests a major downturn, likely caused by external market conditions, reduced consumer demand, or internal operational shifts.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Q3 and Q4 of each year typically show strong performance, likely due to seasonal shopping trends and marketing efforts.</li>
              <li>Q1 2022 started well ($704K in January), but revenue quickly dropped, signaling an overall weak performance compared to previous years.</li>
