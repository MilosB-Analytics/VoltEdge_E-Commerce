            <strong>Revenue Performance & Peak Sales</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>The strongest year by far was 2020 with a total of over <strong>$10.1M</strong>. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic we can observe a steady quarterly revenue increase.</li>
              <li>The best performing period is Q4 2020 with a total of more than <strong>$1.25M</strong> in December.</li>
              <li>A meaningful drop in revenue occurrs in Q2 2021 afterwhich the sales trend remains steady approximately around <strong>$2.2M</strong> until the beggining of 2022, this would be the breaking point where we can see a constant downward trend. </li>

            <strong>Revenue Break Point: Declining Trend 2022</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Q4 of 2022 takes heavy turn as sales reached their overall lowest points, with October<strong>($178K)</strong>, November<strong>($208K)</strong> and December<strong>($262K)</strong> significantly generating less revenue than previous years.</li>
              <li>Revenue declined sharply toward the end of Q3 2022 and throughout Q4, indicating a break from historical seasonal performance. This deviation suggests the impact of internal operational changes, shifts in customer demand, and broader market conditions, warranting deeper investigation to isolate primary drivers. </li>
